note right of pd
We need to be notified before projects start
of the dream so we can decide what needs to be done
to support this project.
end note

note right of todo: this is a todo program that can be viewed and edited by ARB group

note right of SC: project's source control

pd -> review : Notified of a dream
review -> review : Is the dream valid? what high level concerns ?
review -> review : Vote on if project needs special oversight or can pass with self assessment

note left of review
1 vote for special oversight means it becomes special oversight for ARB.
Provide elaboration on why it needs special oversight.
this will be recorded along with the TODO.
end note

alt if needs oversight
    review -> todo : Add todo for special oversight
else
    review -> todo : Self assessment on project due
end
review -> pd : give initial dream feedback and tdl
loop define requirements
    pd -> pr : meetings to define requirements

    note left of pr
    i want to stay out of requirement meetings, they are so talky talky.
    We need the final decision what business wants done first.
    if the proposed tech solution is bad, we can overrule it
    in our review of the requirements and tdl docs.

        review -> review : Determine if project needs special oversight in specialized areas

        note left of review
        this is where we may break responsibility to domain level knowledge
        App Arch, Inf Arch, Data Arch, Security Arch

            note left of review
            this could just be solution architect work or
            an appointed developer from arch team depending on complexity of project,
            but data and azure scripts should be reviewed by
            infrastructure, data, security
            end note
